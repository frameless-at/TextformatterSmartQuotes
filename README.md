# TextformatterSmartQuotes

**A ProcessWire Textformatter that replaces straight quotes (`"..."`) with typographic quotes – only in visible text content.**

---

## ✨ Features

- Replaces `"..."` with typographic quotes like `„..."`, `“…”`, or `« ... »`
- Leaves all HTML markup and attributes untouched
- Simple and safe – no risky regular expressions
- Supports configurable quote styles:
  - **German**: „..."
  - **English**: “...”
  - **French**: « ... »

## 🧠 Why this exists

We needed a way to convert straight quotes into proper typographic ones in content fields – but without breaking HTML attributes like:

```html
<strong style="font-size: 18px;">Improved "well-being"</strong>
```

Most regex-based solutions failed, either:
- Replacing quotes inside HTML attributes (which breaks markup), or
- Missing valid quotes in visible content

This module solves that cleanly by operating only on the **visible text**, ignoring all tags and attributes.
